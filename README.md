# Voice Agent - Your Everyday AI Assistant

Built in Swift for iOS. A hands-free AI assistant that works anywhere - while driving, at the gym, cooking, or on the go.

## Core Features

### üìß **Email Management (via AgentMail MCP)**
- **Read emails** - "What did John email me about?"

- **Smart summaries** - "Summarize today's important emails"

### üìù **Smart Notes System**
- **Create notes** - Capture thoughts instantly with voice
- **Update existing notes** - "Add to my project ideas note"
- **Search across notes** - "Find my notes about machine learning"
- **Combine ideas** - "Merge my startup ideas into one document"
- **Auto-summarize** - Long conversations automatically saved as concise notes

### üîç **Research & Information**
- **Web search** - Real-time information via Brave Search MCP

- **Shopping** - Price comparisons and product search
- **News** - Latest updates on any topic

### üéØ **Intelligent Compilation**
The assistant can compile information from multiple sources and:

## Dedalus MCP Integration

The app uses Dedalus Labs' MCP runner to intelligently route requests to the right tools without hardcoded logic.

**Available MCP Servers**:
- `vroom08/agentmail-mcp` - Full email capabilities (read, send, search)
- `tsion/brave-search-mcp` - Web search and information retrieval  
- `joerup/open-meteo-mcp` - Weather data

**Implementation**: `dedalus-api/api/index.py`

The Python backend receives voice commands from Vapi and uses Dedalus to:
1. Determine which MCP servers are needed
2. Execute them in the right order
3. Combine results intelligently

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "Email the team a summary of today's tech news"
‚Üí Vapi processes voice command
‚Üí Routes to Dedalus backend
‚Üí Dedalus automatically:
  - Uses Brave Search MCP to get tech news
  - Summarizes the information
  - Uses AgentMail MCP to compose and send email
‚Üí Confirms to user via voice
```

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift (iOS app)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Voice AI**: Vapi (GPT-4 + 11Labs voices)
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time sync, note storage)
- **MCP Gateway**: Dedalus Labs (Python backend on Vercel)
- **Database**: Convex for persistent storage

## Use Cases

Perfect for situations where you can't use your hands:
- **Driving** - "Send an email saying I'm running late"
- **Gym** - "Add protein shake recipe to my notes"
- **Cooking** - "What's the weather tomorrow?"
- **Walking** - "Search for the nearest coffee shop"
- **Working** - "Compile today's meeting notes and email to the team"

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pathakmukul/somethin.git
```

2. **Configure environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys:
# - DEDALUS_API_KEY (from dedaluslabs.ai)
# - VAPI_PUBLIC_KEY
# - Email configuration for AgentMail
```

3. **Start Convex backend**
```bash
cd convex
npm install
npx convex dev
```

4. **Deploy Dedalus backend** (optional for local testing)
```bash
cd dedalus-api
pip install -r requirements.txt
vercel dev
```

5. **Run iOS app**
```bash
open VoiceAgentApp.xcodeproj
# Build and run in Xcode
```

## Project Structure

```
VoiceAgentApp/        - Swift/SwiftUI iOS application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/         - VAPIService, LocalToolExecutor, ConvexNotesSync
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Config/           - AppConfig for API keys
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Views/            - VoiceAgentView, SettingsView

convex/               - Backend for note storage and sync
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.ts          - CRUD operations for notes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vapi/             - Tool handlers
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/dedalus.ts    - Dedalus integration stub

dedalus-api/          - Python backend for MCP execution
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/index.py      - Dedalus runner with all MCP servers
```

## Note on Security

All API keys are stored in `.env` and never committed to the repository. The app uses iOS Keychain for secure storage on device.
