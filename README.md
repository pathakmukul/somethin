## Dedalus MCP Integration

The app uses Dedalus Labs' MCP runner to intelligently route requests to the right tools without hardcoded logic.

**Available MCP Servers**:
- `vroom08/agentmail-mcp` - Full email capabilities (read, send, search)
- `tsion/brave-search-mcp` - Web search and information retrieval  
- `joerup/open-meteo-mcp` - Weather data

**Implementation**: `dedalus-api/api/index.py`

The Python backend receives voice commands from Vapi and uses Dedalus to:
1. Determine which MCP servers are needed
2. Execute them in the right order
3. Combine results intelligently

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "Email the team a summary of today's tech news"
‚Üí Vapi processes voice command
‚Üí Routes to Dedalus backend
‚Üí Dedalus automatically:
  - Uses Brave Search MCP to get tech news
  - Summarizes the information
  - Uses AgentMail MCP to compose and send email
‚Üí Confirms to user via voice
```

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Swift (iOS app)
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Voice AI**: Vapi (GPT-4 + 11Labs voices)
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time sync, note storage)
- **MCP Gateway**: Dedalus Labs (Python backend on Vercel)
- **Database**: Convex for persistent storage

## Use Cases

Perfect for situations where you can't use your hands:
- **Driving** - "Send an email saying I'm running late"
- **Gym** - "Add protein shake recipe to my notes"
- **Cooking** - "What's the weather tomorrow?"
- **Walking** - "Search for the nearest coffee shop"
- **Working** - "Compile today's meeting notes and email to the team"
